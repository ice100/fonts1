<h2>How We Use Information</h2>

<p>The main reason we use your information is to develop, deliver and improve our products and services. Additionally, we use your information for the following reasons:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>monitor and analyze trends and usage.</li>
	<li>enhance the safety and security of our products and services.</li>
    <li>verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity.</li>
    <li>conduct research and analysis of users’ behavior to improve our services and content.</li>

</ul>
<br/>
To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal bases:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Provide our service to you. Most of the time, the reason we process your information is to perform the contract that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, to make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you.</li>
	<li>Legitimate interests. We may use your information where we have legitimate interests to do so. For instance, we analyze users’ behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection and other legal purposes.</li>
    <li>Consent. From time to time, we may ask for your consent to use your information for certain specific reasons. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of the Policy.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>

<p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.<br>
<ul>
	<li>Revoking permissions. If you let us use your information, you can always change your mind and simply revoke your permission by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</li>
	<li>Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>How We Share Information</h2>

<p>We may share information about you in the following ways:<br/>
With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:<br/>

	<li>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations.</li>
    <li>protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others.</li>
    <li>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>Our services are not intended for—and we don’t direct them to—anyone under 13. And that’s why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent’s consent before we collect and use that information.<br/>
<br/>
</p>

<h2>Changes to the Policy</h2>

<p>Any information that is collected is subject to the Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify the Policy from time to time.  You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes.
